/**
 * Mini-Services Styles - Main Entry Point
 *
 * This file serves as the main entry point for all mini-services styles.
 * Styles are now organized into modular files for better maintainability:
 *
 * - _layout.scss: Core layout structure (containers, cards, results areas)
 * - _ui.scss: Shared UI components (forms, buttons, alerts, metrics)
 * - _keywords.scss: Keyword analysis tools (density, longtail, difficulty, clustering, LSI)
 * - _readability.scss: Readability analysis tools (formulas, sentences, paragraphs, levels)
 * - _content.scss: Content analysis tools (structure, headings, links, gaps, competitive)
 * - _utilities.scss: Animations, keyframes, text utilities, responsive helpers
