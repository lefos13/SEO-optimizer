## Phase 1 Complete ✅

The project foundation has been successfully set up with:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created organized folder structure
   - Set up src/main, src/renderer, src/preload directories
   - Created database, analyzers, utils directories
   - Set up public folder for static assets

2. **Configuration Files**
   - ✅ ESLint configured for Electron + React
   - ✅ Prettier configured for code formatting
   - ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks installed
   - ✅ lint-staged for automatic code quality checks
   - ✅ VS Code workspace settings

3. **Basic Application**
   - ✅ Updated main.js with proper window configuration
   - ✅ Created preload script with contextBridge
   - ✅ Set up basic HTML structure
   - ✅ Created CSS with design system (colors, utilities)
   - ✅ Temporary renderer entry point

## 🚀 Running the Application

```bash
# Start the application
yarn start

# Start with DevTools (for development)
yarn dev
```

## 📋 Available Commands

```bash
# Development
yarn start              # Launch the application
yarn dev               # Launch with DevTools

# Code Quality
yarn lint              # Check code with ESLint
yarn lint:fix          # Auto-fix ESLint issues
yarn format            # Format code with Prettier
yarn format:check      # Check formatting without changes

# Building
yarn build             # Build for all platforms
yarn build:win         # Build for Windows
yarn build:mac         # Build for macOS
yarn build:linux       # Build for Linux
```

## 🔧 What's Next?

- [ ] Create main App component
- [ ] Build Content Analyzer UI
- [ ] Create Results Display component

### Phase 4: SEO Analyzers

- [ ] Implement keyword density analyzer
- [ ] Create readability scorer
- [ ] Build meta tags analyzer
- [ ] Develop heading structure analyzer

### Phase 5: Integration

- [ ] Connect UI with analyzers
- [ ] Implement IPC handlers
- [ ] Add file operations
- [ ] Create history viewer

## 📝 Development Notes

### Current State

- Basic Electron app is configured and ready
- Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Husky) is active
- Project structure follows best practices
- Security features (contextIsolation, no nodeIntegration) are enabled

### Known Limitations

- React is included in dependencies but not yet integrated with a bundler
- Renderer entry point is currently plain JavaScript
- No bundler configured yet (will be needed for React)

### Before Starting Development

1. Decide on bundler (Webpack, Vite, or electron-forge)
2. Consider TypeScript migration
3. Plan component architecture
4. Design database schema

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ Context Isolation enabled
✅ Node Integration disabled
✅ Secure IPC via preload script
✅ Content Security Policy in HTML

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dependencies Installation Issues

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules .yarn/cache
yarn install
```

### Husky Not Working

```bash
# Reinitialize Husky
yarn husky install
```

### ESLint Errors

```bash
# Auto-fix most issues
yarn lint:fix

# For specific files
yarn eslint --fix path/to/file.js
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use VS Code Extensions**: Install recommended extensions from `.vscode/extensions.json`
2. **Format on Save**: Enabled by default in workspace settings
3. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Code is automatically formatted and linted before each commit
4. **DevTools**: Use `yarn dev` to open with DevTools for debugging

## 🎯 Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Make your changes
3. Code is automatically formatted on save (VS Code)
4. Git pre-commit hook will run on commit:
   - Prettier formats staged files
   - ESLint checks for issues
5. Fix any reported issues
6. Commit succeeds if all checks pass
